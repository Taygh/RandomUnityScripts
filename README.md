# UnityScripts
A compilation of scripts I have made for Unity projects (in C#). Each class is commented to explain functionality in an abstract
introduction and throughout the lines of code. Individual descriptions can also be found below.

Statue:
A script for the statue obstacles found in the game jam version of "Boundless." 
They can be seen in action during this gameplay video: https://youtu.be/J_Gv0B3m5Lk
