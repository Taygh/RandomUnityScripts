# UnityScripts
A compilation of scripts I have made for Unity projects (in C#) that I can only/want to showcase seperate from their respective projects. Each class is commented to explain functionality in an abstract introduction and throughout the lines of code. Individual descriptions can also be found below.

Statue:
A script for the statue obstacles found in the game jam version of "Boundless." 
They can be seen in action during this gameplay video: https://youtu.be/J_Gv0B3m5Lk
